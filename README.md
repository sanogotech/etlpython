## Python Data
If you're building a data warehouse, you need ETL to move data into that storage. To do that, you first extract data from an array of different sources. Then you apply transformations to get everything into a format you can use, and finally, you load it into your data warehouse. 

There are many ways to do this, one of which is the Python programming language. The Python community has created a range of tools to make your ETL life easier and give you control over the process. If you have the time, money, and patience, using Python will ensure your ETL pipeline is streamlined exactly for your business needs.  

With that in mind, here are the top Python ETL Tools for 2021. Some of these let you manage each step of the ETL process, while others are excellent at a specific step. They are organized into groups to make it easier for you to compare them. Letâ€™s go!
